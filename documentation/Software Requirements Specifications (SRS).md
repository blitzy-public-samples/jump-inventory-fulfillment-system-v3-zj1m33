2. Label Printers
   - Connection Type: USB or Network (Ethernet/Wi-Fi)
   - Compatibility: Must support common shipping label sizes (4x6 inches)
   - Driver: Standard printer drivers (e.g., PCL, ZPL)
   - Print Resolution: Minimum 203 dpi

The application will interact with these hardware components through standard operating system interfaces and device drivers. No custom hardware interfaces will be developed as part of this project.

## 3.3 SOFTWARE INTERFACES

The Inventory Management and Fulfillment Application will interface with the following external software systems:

1. Shopify API
   - Purpose: Retrieve unfulfilled orders, update order status, and sync inventory levels
   - Version: Latest stable version of Shopify Admin API
   - Data Format: JSON
   - Communication Protocol: HTTPS
   - Authentication: OAuth 2.0
   - Rate Limits: As per Shopify API documentation, with implemented throttling

2. Sendle API
   - Purpose: Generate shipping labels and retrieve tracking information
   - Version: Latest stable version of Sendle API
   - Data Format: JSON
   - Communication Protocol: HTTPS
   - Authentication: API Key
   - Rate Limits: As per Sendle API documentation, with implemented throttling

3. PostgreSQL Database
   - Purpose: Store application data, including inventory, orders, and user information
   - Version: PostgreSQL 13 or higher
   - Connection: Managed through an ORM (e.g., Sequelize for Node.js or SQLAlchemy for Python)
   - Data Format: SQL

4. AWS Services
   - EC2: For application hosting
   - RDS: For managed PostgreSQL database hosting
   - S3: For storing application logs and backups
   - Interaction: Through AWS SDK for the chosen backend language (Node.js or Python)

## 3.4 COMMUNICATION INTERFACES

The Inventory Management and Fulfillment Application will utilize the following communication interfaces:

1. HTTP/HTTPS
   - Purpose: All client-server communication and API interactions
   - Protocol: HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2
   - Port: 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS)
   - Security: TLS 1.2 or higher for all HTTPS connections

2. WebSockets
   - Purpose: Real-time updates for inventory changes and order status
   - Protocol: WSS (WebSocket Secure)
   - Port: 443
   - Data Format: JSON

3. SMTP
   - Purpose: Sending email notifications for order status updates and system alerts
   - Protocol: SMTP with TLS
   - Port: 587 (TLS) or 465 (SSL)
   - Authentication: Username and password or OAuth 2.0

4. Database Connection
   - Purpose: Communication between the application server and PostgreSQL database
   - Protocol: PostgreSQL wire protocol
   - Port: 5432 (default PostgreSQL port)
   - Security: SSL/TLS encryption for data in transit

5. AWS Service Communication
   - Purpose: Interaction with AWS services (EC2, RDS, S3)
   - Protocol: HTTPS
   - Authentication: AWS IAM roles and policies
   - Data Format: As specified by AWS SDK

All communication interfaces will implement appropriate error handling, retry mechanisms, and logging to ensure reliable and secure data exchange. The application will also respect rate limits and implement backoff strategies where necessary to prevent overwhelming external services.

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project aims to develop a comprehensive web-based Inventory Management and Fulfillment Application for an e-commerce store operating on Shopify. The client faces challenges in efficiently managing inventory and streamlining the order fulfillment process, which are critical for maintaining customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Our proposed solution addresses these pain points by providing a seamless integration between the client's Shopify store, inventory management system, and shipping processes.

The application will:
1. Automatically pull and categorize unfulfilled orders from Shopify
2. Determine order fulfillment feasibility based on real-time inventory levels
3. Facilitate a streamlined fulfillment process using barcode scanning technology
4. Generate shipping labels via Sendle API integration
5. Update Shopify orders and inventory levels in real-time

## OBJECTIVES

1. Enhance operational efficiency by automating order processing and inventory management
2. Reduce order fulfillment errors through barcode scanning validation
3. Minimize shipping delays by prioritizing fulfillable orders
4. Improve inventory accuracy and reduce stockouts
5. Increase customer satisfaction through faster and more accurate order fulfillment
6. Provide actionable insights on inventory needs through unfulfillable order reports

```

### BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS

Several factors could potentially impact the budget, and we have strategies in place to manage these risks:

1. **Scope Creep**
   - Risk: Additional features or changes requested during development.
   - Mitigation: Clearly defined scope in the contract, change request process with associated costs.

2. **Integration Complexities**
   - Risk: Unforeseen challenges with Shopify or Sendle API integrations.
   - Mitigation: Thorough research during planning phase, allocation of contingency budget for potential extra development time.

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Risk: Additional time required to meet performance requirements.
   - Mitigation: Regular performance testing throughout development, early identification of bottlenecks.

4. **Data Migration**
   - Risk: Complexity in migrating existing data if required.
   - Mitigation: Detailed assessment of current data structures, inclusion of data migration specialist if needed (additional cost may apply).

5. **Security Compliance**
   - Risk: Additional security measures required to meet industry standards.
   - Mitigation: Early security audits, inclusion of security best practices in initial development.

6. **Infrastructure Costs**
   - Risk: Potential increase in AWS costs based on usage.
   - Mitigation: Regular monitoring of resource usage, optimization of infrastructure, clear communication with client about potential cost variations.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Budget Risks] --> B[Scope Creep]
    A --> C[Integration Complexities]
    A --> D[Performance Optimization]
    A --> E[Data Migration]

    D --> D1[Regular Testing]
    E --> E1[Data Assessment]
    F --> F1[Early Security Audits]
    G --> G1[Resource Monitoring]
```

To manage these budget considerations effectively, we will:

1. Maintain open communication with the client about potential risks and their impact on the budget.
2. Conduct regular project status meetings to identify and address any issues early.
3. Utilize the contingency budget judiciously to address unforeseen challenges.
4. Provide detailed reports on budget utilization and projections throughout the project lifecycle.

By implementing these strategies, we aim to deliver the project within the estimated budget while maintaining flexibility to address unexpected challenges.

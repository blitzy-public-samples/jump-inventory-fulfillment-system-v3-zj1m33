```

### Key Components

1. **Frontend**: A responsive web application built with React.js, optimized for desktop browsers.
2. **Backend**: Server-side application developed using Node.js or Python (with a framework like Express.js or Flask), handling business logic and API integrations.
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS RDS for data persistence.
4. **External Integrations**: 
   - Shopify API for order and product synchronization
   - Sendle API for shipping label generation and tracking
5. **Infrastructure**: Hosted on AWS EC2 instances with additional AWS services for scalability and reliability.

### Core Functionalities

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| User Authentication | Secure login system with role-based access control |
| Order Management | Automatic retrieval and categorization of unfulfilled Shopify orders |
| Inventory Tracking | Real-time inventory management with barcode scanning capabilities |
| Order Fulfillment | Guided fulfillment process with barcode validation and automated shipping label generation |
| Reporting | Generation of unfulfillable order reports and inventory insights |

### System Interactions

1. The application continuously syncs with the Shopify store to retrieve unfulfilled orders and update inventory levels.
2. Users interact with the system through a web interface, performing tasks such as order processing and inventory management.
3. During order fulfillment, the system interfaces with barcode scanners for item verification and label printers for shipping label output.
4. The Sendle API is utilized for generating shipping labels and retrieving tracking information.
5. All data is persisted in the PostgreSQL database, with real-time updates reflected in the user interface.

This system is designed to significantly improve operational efficiency, reduce errors in order fulfillment, and provide real-time visibility into inventory levels and order statuses. By leveraging modern web technologies and cloud infrastructure, the application ensures scalability, reliability, and seamless integration with existing e-commerce operations.

# 5. SYSTEM DESIGN

## 5.1 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

The Inventory Management and Fulfillment Application will utilize the following programming languages:

| Language | Purpose | Justification |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| JavaScript (Node.js) | Backend server | - Excellent performance for I/O-intensive operations<br>- Large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks<br>- Seamless JSON handling for API integrations |
| JavaScript (React) | Frontend UI | - Component-based architecture for reusable UI elements<br>- Virtual DOM for efficient updates<br>- Large community support and extensive libraries |
| SQL | Database queries | - Powerful querying capabilities for complex data operations<br>- Standard language for relational databases (PostgreSQL) |
| Python | Data processing and scripts | - Excellent for data manipulation and analysis<br>- Useful for creating maintenance scripts and data migration tools |

## 5.2 DATABASE DESIGN

The application will use PostgreSQL as the primary database management system. The database design will follow a relational model to ensure data integrity and efficient querying. Below is a high-level schema design:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    User ||--o{ Order : manages
    User {
        int id PK
        string username
        string email
        string password_hash
        string role
        datetime created_at
        datetime updated_at
    }
    Order ||--|{ OrderItem : contains
    Order {
        int id PK
        string shopify_order_id FK
        int user_id FK
        string status
        datetime order_date
        string shipping_address
        string tracking_number
        datetime fulfilled_at
        datetime created_at
        datetime updated_at
    }
    OrderItem {
        int id PK
        int order_id FK
        int product_id FK
        int quantity
        decimal price
    }
    Product ||--o{ OrderItem : "is in"
    Product ||--o{ InventoryItem : "has"
    Product {
        int id PK
        string shopify_product_id FK
        string name
        string sku
        string barcode
        string description
        decimal price
        datetime created_at
        datetime updated_at
    }
    InventoryItem {
        int id PK
        int product_id FK
        int quantity
        string location
        datetime last_counted
        datetime created_at
        datetime updated_at
    }
    InventoryAdjustment ||--|| InventoryItem : adjusts
    InventoryAdjustment {
        int id PK
        int inventory_item_id FK
        int user_id FK
        int quantity_change
        string reason
        datetime created_at
    }
```

Key considerations for the database design:

1. Indexing on frequently queried columns (e.g., order_id, product_id, barcode)
2. Use of foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity
3. Implementation of database triggers for automatic timestamp updates
4. Partitioning of large tables (e.g., Order, InventoryAdjustment) for improved query performance

## 5.3 API DESIGN

The application will implement a RESTful API design for both internal communication between frontend and backend, as well as for integration with external services (Shopify and Sendle). The API will follow these principles:

1. Use of standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
2. Stateless communication
3. Resource-based URLs
4. JSON for data exchange
5. Use of HTTP status codes for error handling

Key API endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/orders` | GET | Retrieve list of orders |
| `/api/orders/{id}` | GET | Retrieve specific order details |
| `/api/orders/{id}/fulfill` | POST | Process order fulfillment |
| `/api/inventory` | GET | Retrieve inventory levels |
| `/api/inventory/{id}` | PUT | Update inventory item |
| `/api/products` | GET | Retrieve product list |
| `/api/shipping-label` | POST | Generate shipping label |

API security measures:

1. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
2. Rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. Input validation and sanitization
4. HTTPS encryption for all API communications

## 5.4 USER INTERFACE DESIGN

The user interface will be developed using React.js, focusing on a clean, intuitive, and responsive design optimized for desktop browsers. The UI will follow these design principles:

1. Consistent layout and navigation across all pages
2. Use of a modular component-based architecture
3. Responsive design for various screen sizes
4. Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)

Key UI components:

1. Dashboard
   - Summary widgets for unfulfilled orders, inventory levels, and recent activities
   - Quick action buttons for common tasks

2. Order Management
   - Tabular view of orders with sorting and filtering options
   - Detailed order view with fulfillment actions

3. Inventory Management
   - Grid view of inventory items with search and filter capabilities
   - Barcode scanning interface for quick updates

4. Fulfillment Process
   - Step-by-step guided interface for order fulfillment
   - Barcode scanning integration for item verification

5. Reporting
   - Customizable charts and graphs for inventory and order analytics
   - Export functionality for generated reports

User interface mockup for the dashboard:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Header - Logo and Navigation] --> B[Dashboard]
    B --> C[Summary Widgets]
    B --> D[Recent Orders]
    B --> E[Inventory Alerts]
    B --> F[Quick Actions]
    C --> G[Unfulfilled Orders Count]
    C --> H[Low Stock Items]
    C --> I[Orders Fulfilled Today]
    D --> J[Table with Recent Order Details]
    E --> K[List of Low Stock or Out of Stock Items]
    F --> L[Scan Barcode Button]
    F --> M[Create New Order Button]
    F --> N[Generate Report Button]
```

This user interface design ensures a user-friendly experience that aligns with the application's goals of efficient inventory management and order fulfillment. The use of React.js will allow for the creation of reusable components and efficient state management, resulting in a responsive and performant user interface.
